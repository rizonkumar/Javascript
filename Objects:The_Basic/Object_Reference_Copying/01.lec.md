A variable assigned to an object stores not the object itself, but its “address in memory” – in other words “a reference” to it.

```let user = {
  name: "John"
};
```

When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.
let user = { name: "John" };

let admin = user; // copy the reference

Now we have two variables, each storing a reference to the same object:

```
let user = { name: 'John' };

let admin = user;

admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference

alert(user.name); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
```
