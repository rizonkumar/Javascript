## Garbage Collection in JavaScript: A Simplified Explanation

**Imagine your room is a computer's memory.** You have toys scattered around (objects in JavaScript). When you're done playing with a toy, you put it away (garbage collection).

### How does JavaScript know when to clean up?

It uses a system called **reachability**. Think of it like a game of "Follow the Dots."

- **Roots:** These are the starting points, like your favorite toys or the bed you sleep on.
- **Reachability:** If you can connect a toy to a root by following a chain of other toys, it's reachable. If not, it's considered "garbage."

**Example:**

1. **You have a doll (object).**
2. **You put it on your bed (root).**
3. **The doll is reachable.**

**Now, you decide to give the doll away.**

1. **You remove the doll from your bed.**
2. **The doll is no longer reachable.**
3. **The garbage collector (like a cleaning robot) comes along and takes the doll away.**

**Key Points:**

- **Automatic:** JavaScript handles memory management for you.
- **Reachability:** Objects are kept if they can be reached from a root.
- **Garbage Collector:** Removes unreachable objects.

**Remember:** While garbage collection is helpful, it's still good practice to avoid creating unnecessary objects or keeping references to them when you don't need them. This helps keep your "room" (memory) tidy!

## Code Examples

### Basic Example

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
};

// User is reachable
console.log(user);

// Make user unreachable
user = null;

// Garbage collector will eventually remove user
```

### Example with Multiple References

```javascript
let user = {
  name: "John",
};
let admin = user;

// Both user and admin reference the same object
console.log(user, admin);

// Setting user to null doesn't remove the object
user = null;

// The object is still reachable through admin
console.log(admin);

// Setting admin to null will make the object unreachable
admin = null;
```

### Example with Circular References

```javascript
let person1 = {
  name: "Alice",
};
let person2 = {
  name: "Bob",
};

person1.friend = person2;
person2.friend = person1;

// Both objects have circular references
console.log(person1, person2);

// Setting person1 or person2 to null won't break the cycle
person1 = null;
console.log(person2);

// The garbage collector might not remove the objects immediately due to the circular reference
```

**Note:** While the garbage collector typically handles circular references, it's important to be aware of them and avoid creating unnecessary cycles to prevent potential memory leaks.
