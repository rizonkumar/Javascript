## Understanding Object.assign and Deep Cloning

**The Problem with Shallow Copying:**

When you use `Object.assign` to create a clone of an object, it performs a **shallow copy**. This means it copies the top-level properties of the object, but not the nested objects. If a nested object is modified in either the original or the clone, both will be affected because they reference the same object.

**The Example:**

In the given code, we have an `user` object with a `sizes` property, which is itself an object. When we use `Object.assign` to create a `clone` of `user`, the `sizes` property is copied by reference. This means both `user` and `clone` share the same `sizes` object.

**Visualizing the Problem:**

```
user: {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
}

clone: {
  name: "John",
  sizes: <same object as user.sizes>
}
```

As you can see, both `user` and `clone` point to the same `sizes` object. So, when you change a property in one, it reflects in the other.

**The Solution: Strucutred Cloning**
